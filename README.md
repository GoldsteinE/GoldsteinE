Doing horrible things with Rust.

Iâ€™m currently working on [name-it] project, which brings a restricted subset of `type_alias_impl_trait` to stable Rust.

My [dotfiles] could be interesting to you if you use tiling WMs and/or Neovim.

[Keyoxide] lists some ways to contact me, along with my public key (which is also [available on goldstein.rs][key]). My Telegram username is [@goldsteinq].

You can use any pronouns to refer to me.
